                        " Did I make the right decision by choosing to pursue my
                        MBA!? " , I thought to myself." Am I on the right path
                        or will I be wasting my time, money and effort!?" Dr.
                        Daniel's words came directly at the time of me asking
                        myself these questions. I wasn't going to believe Dr.
                        Daniel when he confidently claimed that I was going to
                        enjoy my MBA college life here at PBS, not because he
                        didn't feel trustworthy but because of my life's motto
                        which is to try things for oneself first, first
                        experience them firsthand and then and only then believe
                        them.<br />
                        I had spent only a week in my college when I realised
                        taht the best of the teaching staff has been appointed
                        here. One of the major academic shocks I received was to
                        how well the teaching faculty bonded with the students.
                        It was amazing and felt odd because I had spent more
                        than four years of life studying engineering from a
                        college which did not believe in student teacher bonding
                        or extra curricular activities for that matter. Dr.
                        Daniel had not divulge any details about college culture
                        in the induction speech. That may be one of the reasons
                        as to why every experience seemed all the more
                        surprising when it came to pass! I still wasn't going to
                        jump to the conclusion that the college was as fantastic
                        as others had claimed. I was enjoying my interaction
                        with the faculty for sure but that was just the
                        beginning of more fun to come.

                      <p class="content-para">
                        I have always enjoyed music and dance but not practicing
                        dance daily had turned my once flexible body into a log
                        of wood. What has MBA got to do with dance you ask!?
                        Garba! One of the most pleasant news i heard about my
                        MBA college celebrating Navaratri festival was that it
                        was celebrating Navaratri festival in the first place! I
                        came to MBA form an engineering college which did not
                        believe in granting even a single holiday to students
                        let alone celebrate it. It was a joyful news for me! Now
                        can you imagine my amazement when I found out that two
                        garba dance instructors were appointed by the college to
                        teach students garba! " One hour of garba daily! Wow!" I
                        said to myself. And that's just the practice session. On
                        the final day of Navaratri all the students had to come
                        dressed in traditional attire and dance to garba music .
                        But that's not it! There was more! There were prizes
                        held for students based on their dancing skills ,
                        costume and enthusiasm in general.
                      </p>

                      <p class="content-para">
                        If the enjoyment from cultural activities was not enough
                        then the students were further encouraged to participate
                        in extracurricular activities . And how!? The college
                        would pay half of the participation fees for any extra
                        curricular activity the student participated in. The
                        first thing that I did after reaching home was to check
                        exactly how much fees I was paying. Was I paying way too
                        much fees for the college to have such encouragement
                        schemes!? But no, the fees were totally normal! The
                        college would pay the entire participation fees if he
                        wins any college competition! Even students who won
                        consolation prizes were facilitated in the college
                        again. Now I was sure , there definitely some wrong with
                        the college fees I was paying!
                      </p>

                      <p class="content-para">
                        Three months in this college now , I find myself
                        thinking about the director's words during the induction
                        programme. He was right. I was enjoying my MBA life like
                        anything. It is said that as you grow older you come to
                        know beforehand whether you are going to miss something
                        when it goes away. I can't speak for others but I for
                        sure know that I am going to miss my MBA college life. I
                        can totally relate to the lyrics of the famous song ' I
                        am really gonna miss this place , I am gonna miss my
                        college days'.
