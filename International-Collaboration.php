                                          Singapore is a country where east meets west. The mixture of these two cultures willallow students fromallparts of
                                          the world to feelat home in the environment.
                                          Being a multi-racial society, Singapore will definitely allow students to have an extraordinary cultural experience
                                          and enable themto develop a deeperunderstanding of the different races and cultures 
                                          Singapore is no doubt, considered to be one of the safest countries withhighsecurity and political stability
                                          The public transport system is very well established, making it convenient for students to travel around if they
                                          would like to do so. There are many expatriates and foreign students residing in Singapore and thus, students willnot
